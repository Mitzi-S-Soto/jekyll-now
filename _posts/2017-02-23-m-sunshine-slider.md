This slide was created to serve the purpose for a website I was developing for a client.

This slider takes HTML elements with the same class and hides all but a chosen element with said class. It then automatically loops, changing between the different elements with said class. It has next and previous buttons as well as dot indicators that show which slide is active, and when clicked changes to that slide.

A bug was fixed that had slides chosen by dot indicators or next/prev button to quickly jump to the next slide.

Code is heavily commented.

NOTE: Currently you can only have one slider on a page. It will not work if you put two or more sliders in the HTML.
